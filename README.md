# Pokemon Go: A Data Science Approach


#### *A Plotly Dash App*.

A multi-tab dashboard application that analyzes Pokemon Go data to summarize statistics, determine the best pokemon in the game, and find similar pokemon using data science. Some of the methods used include multi-objective optimization and unsupervised learning.

The data used for this App was scraped from multiple sources using Selenium. For more details see the code in the accompanying [notebook](https://github.com/kristokrugger/Pokemon-Go-App/blob/master/scrape_data/scrape_data.ipynb).

The application has been deployed on Heroku, you can find it [here](http://pokemon-go-datascience-app.herokuapp.com/pokemon-go-app/).
